ShortURL Microservice

install these
npm install valid-url (to validate URL's)
npm install mongodb
npm install mongoose

code explanation : 
in app.post 
-1st middleware 
the reason why there is a try_catch block is
to catch any errors when an invalid url is being posted.
and then inside it there is 2 different checking procedure the first one is 
to check if a url is in the correct format -> httpS://example.com/route/api
the second one is to prevent a url without TLD -> https://axel
without the dns lookup the url will be submitted

-2nd middleware
it checks whether a url is already in the database and then returns the url and the short url

-3rd middleware
when there is no matching url in database it will generate new number for the short url
and then it will save the data inside the database
